# Tasks about functions and nested loops

0-isupper.c: it checks for uppercase character.

1-isdigit.c: it checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2-mul.c: it multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c: it prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c: it prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line, and do not print 2 and 4.

5-more_numbers.c: it prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6-print_line.c: it draws a straight line in the terminal. If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n.

7-print_diagonal.c: it draws a diagonal line on the terminal. If n is 0 or less, the function should onl print a \n.

8-print_square.c: it prints a square using the character #, followed by a new line. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line.

9-fizz_buzz.c: it prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the mutiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

10-print_triangle.c: it prints a triangle using the character #, followed by a new line. If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line.
